    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>I'm showing you my favorite way to grill ribs, which of course, 
        is not the same as barbecued ribs. Those are cooked low and slow in a smoker and served 
        as-is, with BBQ sauce on the side. Whereas, these are cooked first, then sliced, 
        and then each rib is glazed with our beautiful sticky sauce on the grill.
